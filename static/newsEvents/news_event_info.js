    "<b style='color: red'>*** BIG NEWS ***</b>  We have changed our name! Formerly known as East Bristol Hops, going forward, our network of patchwork \
    farmers will be known as <b>Bristol Hops Collective</b>. This will better reflect the reach of our growers and make \
    us more inclusive. We also hope this will clear up any confusion prospective new members may have over who may join us. \
    For years Easton Promise has comprised of hops grown all over Bristol and we decided it was time our name was more representative of all our growers.",
