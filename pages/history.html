                    Bristol Hops Collective formally East Bristol Hops was formed in 2016 by four friends who had the idea to bring together a
                    community of hop growers in Bristol who collectively would provide green hops to a local brewery for a
                    uniquely Bristolian brew.<br>
                    Within a few weeks of first talking about the idea and approaching a few breweries in the bristol area, 
                    the team managed to get (Dawkins Ales) on board and an
                    enthusiastic community of growers soon followed. That September 7kg of fresh, green hops were harvested and were used
                    to make the first edition
                    of a beer dubbed Easton Promise, which we launched during Cask Ale Week.

                    The association has gone from strength to strength since that first year as plants get more established,
                    the number of contributors increases
                    and the amount of harvested hops goes up. In our second year, the harvest was over 20 kilos - a
                    significant milestone as it meant the
                    2017 beer contained only locally grown cones.
                    Bringing together people with a passion for beer, small breweries and their community has been the chief
                    goal of the association since its inception.

                <p class="abouthebrew">
                    The Beer was called Easton Promise â€“ a name that was chosen in a competition held amongst our first wave
                    of growers, who now number well over a hundred and are spread all over the Bristol area.

                <p class="brewrecipe">
                    The recipe is somewhat of a secret, as it changes year on year, but we <strong>Promise</strong> you it's good!
                </p>
                <p class="brewrecipe">
                    What we can tell you, at the time Dawkins Ales expertly crafted our hops into this fantastic beer, which is
                    packed full of locally-grown wet Bullion, Fuggles, Primadonna (UK) hops, Cascade and the odd bit of Bramling Cross.
                    <br>
                    Its super-fresh, grassy, hoppy flavours are only possible because the hops are picked straight off the
                    bine, capturing all the delicate volatile aromas from the natural hop oils.
                    <br>
                    What's the ABV? <br>
                    The Average ABV was around 4.4%
