                <p>
                    At Bristol Hops Collective we are committed to providing welcoming, rewarding and fun environments. 
                    This applies to our team, our members, and any other persons who visit or attend any event hosted by us. 
                    To advance this mission volunteers of Bristol Hops Collective must act with integrity, professionalism and lead by example by treating 
                    all others as they would wish to be treated themselves, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, 
                    disability (mental or physical), age, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, neuro(a)typicality, or religion. 
                    <br><br>

                    Abusive, harassing, aggressive or offensive behaviour towards others will not be tolerated. 
                    These behaviours include, but are not limited too: inappropriate or non-consensual speech, touching, 
                    gesturing or posturing that causes offence or discomfort, or coercive behaviour, where the behaviour is known 
                    or reasonably ought to be recognised as unwanted or unwelcome.
                    <br><br>

                    We have ZERO TOLERANCE for: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, violence or harassment in any way, 
                    shape or form. Picture, video content or language of a sexual or offensive nature is not welcome.
                    We expect all people for whom this policy applies to act with integrity, courtesy and respect for others. 

                    <br><br>
                    If you are witness to failures to act within our code of conduct you can report them to our admin team 
                    <a href="mailto:bristolhopscollective@gmail.com">bristolhopscollective@gmail.com</a>
                    
                    <br><br>
                    Failure to act within the terms of our Code of Conduct for our volunteers will result in appropriate disciplinary actions and process. 

                    <br><br>
                    Failure to act within the terms of our Code of Conduct by members or guests of members of Bristol Hops Collective will result 
                    in being asked to leave, and may result in a lifetime ban.
