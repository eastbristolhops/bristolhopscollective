                <p class="wikisub-heading">Ever wondered why they call a hop plant a bine and not a vine? Well in this
                    HopsWiki we hope to demystify that and some of the other preconceptions people have about the hop plant,
                    as well as giving tips on how best to grow and care for them!
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragarphheading">What are hops?</h2>
                <p>Humulus lupulus (which means ‘wolf of the woods’) is the Latin name for the hop. It is a tall climbing
                    plant and is “dioecious”, which means that male and female plants are separate. It is the female plant
                    which bears the hop cones required in brewing beer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hop plants can be expected to remain productive for 10-20 years, depending on the variety. They can have
                    a root depth of almost 4 meters and can grow as high as 5 meters. Hop plants typically start to flower
                    mid to late July, which is when the cones start to develop. The cones consist of multiple layers of
                    petals where the lupulin glands form and they look like large yellow pollen grains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hop plants die back to ground level each winter, but as they come back every spring they’re classed as a
                    perennial. Also, because they have no woody stems above ground they’re also classed as a herbaceous
                    plant. Therefore, a hop plant is called a ’herbaceous perennial’.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragarphheading">Bine or Vine?</h2>
                <p>
                    The difference in a bining and a vining plant is determined by taking into consideration how they grow.
                    A vine (eg grape) climbs using tendrils to latch on to things, gripping as it goes, whereas a bine grows
                    by wrapping its stem around a supporting structure in a corkscrew or helix shape. If you grow runner
                    beans you will already be familiar with this growth habit!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each year a hop plant will produce brand new stems or bines. Each bine has hairs growing backwards from
                    the tip which help it to grip and provide structure as it wraps and twines itself up and around any
                    support - it is these coarse hairs which scratch your bare skin.
                </p>

                <p class="paragarphsubheading">Location:</p>
                <p>
                    Hops ideally produce best the further south you are, so in Bristol, we are fairly lucky. Hops need
                    around 6-8 hours of sun a day, so a south-facing aspect and direct sunlight is ideal, just try to keep heat off the roots.
                </p>
                <p class="paragarphsubheading">Soil & Planting:</p>
                <p>
                    Hops ideally should be planted in spring, late enough to avoid a frost. Hops prefer loose,
                    non-compacted, easy draining,
                    slightly acidic and highly nutritious soil.<br> That being said a soil with a PH of 6.2-6.8 works well
                    for most hop varieties.
                </p>

                            Some people skip this step, but having good drainage is key to having healthy plants, so
                            begin by filling the biggest pot you have about 1"-2" with gravel. Then fill the pot with good quality compost mixed with top soil.

                        <p>
                            Hops grow best planted directly in the ground, but they also grow well in a pot as big as possible (minimum of 40 litre volume, and at least 30 cm deep)
                            you want to then create a 3” trench to put the
                            rhizome in so just the crown is above the mulch level.
                            <br>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> If growing hops in the ground it tend to spread sideways much like garden mint, so it is an idea to sink a big bottomless pot in the 
                            ground around the rhizome to 
                            stop it from spreading so it can put effort in to growing up rather than across.

                            Pack the soil lightly around the rhizome to ensure there is plenty of air and then cover with mulch
                            or straw. This helps to keep the rhizome cool, prevents water loss and suppresses weeds.

                            You want to keep the ground moist. Watering every couple of days will be sufficient unless
                            the temperature is really hot.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the plant is in a pot check it every day in summer - when the temperatures are in the mid-20s
                            and the pots are in direct sunlight the rhizome can overheat, causing premature browning of the
                            leaves and even a complete failure of the plant. In these conditions you will probably need to
                            water both morning and evening.

                    Hop bines want to grow vertically, but can be trained to grow horizontally. For this, they require a
                    fence, rope, wall, hedge or trellis to grow along
                </p>

                <p class="underimage">
                    If using a rope, be aware that during the main flowering season the plants can get dense foliage and
                    therefore can be susceptible to high winds, so using a thick rope or wire is preferable. The most
                    traditional way is to use a coir rope (made from coconut husk). Try to avoid bailing style twine or
                    nylon, as the bines tend to slip on these. If they do so they will fail to grow to their full potential.
                <p>
                    Once the new season’s growth has started to emerge, select the 3-4 most healthy-looking shoots and trim
                    off the rest to ground level. If they are still young you might consider cooking them up as a grower’s
                    feast. Alternatively, young hop bine cuttings make great propagating material – try popping them in some
                    gritty compost, leave the pot in the warm shade somewhere and see what happens!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the bines are long enough start to wrap them around the supports you’ve put in place. When the
                    bines are over 2 to 3 foot, clear off at least a foot’s worth of the bottom leaves. This helps with
                    ventilation and also cuts the chances of disease such as powdery mildew taking hold.

                <p>
                    Harvesting is usually done around mid September. In the first year, the yield will generally be
                    quite small, but it should increase year on year.

                <p>
                    Hop cones are ready to harvest when they are dry/papery to the touch, spring back when squeezed, have a
                    strong beer aroma and leave an oily residue on your fingers. When you think they’re ripe pick one and
                    open it - it should be full of thick yellow-gold lupulin powder.

                    Hop cones may not mature evenly so it’s important to harvest those that are ready. Hops can easily be
                    frozen and as our collaborative beer is made with green hops, there is no need to dry them first, just
                    pick and freeze them until we call for the hops to be dropped off.

                    After harvest and when the leaves have started to brown and dieback, cut the bines off at just above
                    ground level and cover with mulch. Adding some fertiliser such as manure or chicken poo pellets can work
                    well now too.
