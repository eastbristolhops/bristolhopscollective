                So what's it all about?
            </p>
            <p>
                Good question! we are an ever-expanding independent group of like-minded people, 
                who love to grow hop plants and drink quality
                beer! It's all about hops and beer but mostly hops. Whether they’re in pots or the ground, and
                whether they’re on our allotments, balconies, gardens or pretty much anywhere hops can grow, we
                grow them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visit our <a class="inlinelink" href="pages/wiki.html">HopsWiki</a> for more information on
                growing hops.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everyone who gets involved will join a passionate community of growers and experience the simple
                pleasure of watching the hop mature, as well as the joy of harvesting their ‘cones’ on the same day as
                everyone else and collectively adding them to that year’s brew.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beer is usually made with dried hops or compressed dried pellets which have lost a lot of their oils and
                flavours. Our green hop ale is unusual because we get the hops from the bines to the brewing kettle in
                hours, so more of the flavour is preserved.
            </p>
            <p>
                In other words, with good local hops, you can brew a unique beer with a very special taste.
            </p>

                By early autumn the beer is ready for sampling, which everyone in the collective gets to do at a party
                as soon as it’s brewed.

                <p>
                    As we only use green "wet" hops in our beer there is no need to convert the hops into pellets this saves time and energy, also with our collective of growers nestled 
                    so close to the breweries, this slashes transportation needs, reducing the carbon footprint.
                    The best part as our plants regrow each year the collective can produce sustainable hops that help
                    keep our collaborative beers eco-friendly and close to home.

                        Guy Manchester has been working hard createing the Hoppiness: Brewing with care homes.<br> 
                        The Hoppiness project involves working alongside older adults living in care homes, their carers, 
                        and local brewers to explore the histories and cultures of brewing in the South West and build towards 
                        the production of a beer through communal hop growing. This co-produced project was borne out of a desire 
                        to disrupt entrenched cultural representations of people with dementia.   <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/brigstow/research/projects/2024/hoppiness-ep.html?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2r7L\
