                        Good question! formally East Bristol Hops, we are an ever-expanding independent group of like-minded people, 
                        who love to grow hop plants and drink quality
                        beer!It's all about hops and beer but mostly hops. Whether they’re in pots or the ground, and
                        whether they’re on our allotments, balconies, gardens or pretty much anywhere hops can grow, we will
                        grow them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Visit our <a class="inlinelink"  style="color: #007bff;" href="pages/wiki.html"><strong>HopsWiki</strong></a> for more information on
                        growing hops.

                    <p>
                        Everyone who gets involved will join a passionate community of growers and experience the simple
                        pleasure of watching the hop mature, as well as the joy of harvesting their ‘cones’ on the same day as
                        everyone else and collectively adding them to that year’s brew.
                    </p>

                        Beer is usually made with dried hops or compressed dried pellets which have lost a lot of their oils and
                        flavours. Our green hop ale is unusual because we get the hops from the bines to the brewing kettle in
                        hours, so more of the flavour is preserved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, with good local hops, you can brew a unique beer with a very special taste.

                    <p class="oldcrewstory">
                        East Bristol Hops was formed in 2016 by four friends who had the idea to bring together a
                        community of hop growers in Bristol who collectively would provide green hops to a local brewery for a
                        uniquely Bristolian brew.<br>
                        Within a few weeks of first talking about the idea and approaching a few breweries in the bristol area, 
                        the team managed to get (Dawkins Ales) on board and an
                        enthusiastic community of growers soon followed. That September 7kg of fresh, green hops were harvested and were used
                        to make the first edition
                        of a beer dubbed Easton Promise, which we launched during Cask Ale Week.

                        The association has gone from strength to strength since that first year as plants get more established,
                        the number of contributors increases
                        and the amount of harvested hops goes up. In our second year, the harvest was over 20 kilos - a
                        significant milestone as it meant the
                        2017 beer contained only locally grown cones.
                        Bringing together people with a passion for beer, small breweries and their community has been the chief
                        goal of the association since its inception. <br> If you'd like to get involved,

                        packed full of locally-grown wet Bullion, Fuggles, Primadonna (UK) hops, Cascade and the odd bit of Bramling Cross.

                        Its super-fresh, grassy, hoppy flavours are only possible because the hops are picked straight off the
                        Bine, capturing all the delicate volatile aromas from the natural hop oils.
